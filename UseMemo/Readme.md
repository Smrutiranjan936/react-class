useMemo in React is a hook that memoizes (caches) the result of a computation to optimize performance. 
It prevents expensive recalculations on every render by recomputing only when its dependencies change. 
Useful for optimizing complex calculations, avoiding unnecessary re-renders, and improving efficiency in functional components.
