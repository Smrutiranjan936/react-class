A Functional Component in React is a JavaScript function that returns JSX to define UI elements. It's simpler than class components, 
uses hooks for state and lifecycle features, and promotes reusability. Introduced in React 16.8, itâ€™s now the preferred way to write 
components due to its conciseness and performance benefits.
